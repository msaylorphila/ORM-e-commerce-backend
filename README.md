# ORM-e-commerce-backend

## Description

Using sequalize I was able to build the back end database for an e-commerce website. Given starter code I wrote models for my database connecting them through keys, seeded that with the information I was given, then built routes to access them using insomnia to display these routes in the walk through recording.

## Installation

To start this up you will need to run an npm install through the package.json file that was provided. This will provide you with sequalize and mysql2 as well as express to start your own localized server.

## Usage

To use this application you will first need to install your required packages through npm. After doing so you will move on to create the database through sourcing the schema file and then seed the database through running the command "npm run seed" in your terminal. Once that is finished run the command "npm run start" to start your server and start utilizing the routes.
